# DD-WRT Phone Home

A simple little bash / shell script that you can install on your [dd-wrt](https://dd-wrt.com/) router to make it phones home.

This is usefull if you have a whole bunch of remote dd-wrt routers and want a way to tell if one of the routers is offline or needs to be looked at in person.
